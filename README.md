# Solari - Smart Glasses Scanner

A Flutter prototype application for scanning and connecting to smart glasses devices via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## Overview

Solari is a specialized Bluetooth scanner application designed specifically for smart glasses devices. Unlike generic BLE scanners, this app focuses only on discovering and connecting to smart glasses, providing a clean wireframe interface for prototyping smart glasses interactions.

## Features

### üîç **Smart Glasses Detection**
- Scans specifically for smart glasses devices
- Filters devices by known smart glasses names (RayNeo, Nreal, Magic Leap, etc.)
- 30-second scanning timeout for better device discovery

### üì± **Simplified UI**
- Dark theme wireframe design
- Minimal interface focused on core functionality
- Prototype-ready screens for smart glasses interaction

### üîó **Connection Management**
- One-tap connection to discovered smart glasses
- Real-time connection status monitoring
- Automatic service discovery upon connection
- Signal strength (RSSI) display

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Glasses Features (Prototype)**
- Camera Control interface
- Display Settings
- Audio Controls  
- Navigation
- Notifications
- *Note: These are wireframe placeholders for future development*

## App Flow

1. **Bluetooth Check** ‚Üí Ensures Bluetooth is enabled
2. **Device Scanning** ‚Üí Scans for smart glasses devices only
3. **Device Selection** ‚Üí Shows discovered smart glasses with connect option
4. **Device Interface** ‚Üí Connected device management and feature access

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Bluetooth**: flutter_blue_plus package
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux)
